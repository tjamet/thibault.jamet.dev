I am a seasoned Technical Product Owner and DevOps Engineer with over a decade of experience in platform engineering and cloud infrastructure. Based in Barcelona, I specialize in creating scalable solutions that empower organizations to build and deploy software efficiently.

At Adevinta, I have led transformative initiatives, scaling Kubernetes clusters to handle 300k requests per second at peak. My expertise spans DevOps, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud technologies, with a focus on enhancing developer experiences.

My background includes roles in backend engineering and embedded systems, providing me with a unique perspective on complex infrastructure challenges.
I am known for my contributions to open-source projects and my ability to combine technical excellence with strategic thinking.

As I look towards the future, I aim to shape how organizations approach infrastructure and platform engineering, developing architectures that create force-multiplier effects for engineering teams while maintaining operational excellence.
