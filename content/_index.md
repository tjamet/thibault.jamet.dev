I am a Technical Product Owner and DevOps Engineer with over a decade of experience in platform engineering and cloud infrastructure.
Based in Barcelona, I have spent the last 8 years working on scalable solutions to help organizations build and deploy software more efficiently.

At Adevinta, I have been fortunate to contribute to initiatives such as scaling Kubernetes clusters to handle high traffic volumes.
My experience covers Development, DevOps, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud technologies,
with a particular interest in improving developer experiences and integrating tools and systems.

With a background in backend and embedded software development, I enjoy tackling complex infrastructure challenges and
exploring ways to unify products, tools, and workflows into cohesive systems.
I am always eager to learn and collaborate to drive efficiency and innovation.

I value contributing to open-source projects and strive to combine technical skills with strategic thinking.
I am passionate about supporting the future of infrastructure and platform engineering, aiming to help
develop architectures that empower engineering teams and promote operational excellence.
