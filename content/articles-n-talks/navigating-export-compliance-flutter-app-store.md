How do you navigate cryptographic export compliance when publishing a Flutter app to the Apple App Store?
This post recounts my journey through the maze of legal requirements, technical investigation, and the surprising complexity behind a seemingly simple HTTPS connection.
I share the confusion many developers face, the technical deep-dive into how Flutter handles encryption, and the critical importance of making the right compliance declaration to avoid legal and account risks.
