In this webinar I share our experience with my colleague [Alfredo Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredolopezsalcedo/), in Adevinta, a leading European online classifieds company, our experience implementing large-scale observability. The talk covers:

- **Challenges faced:** Adevinta describes the technical and organizational hurdles encountered when adopting a comprehensive observability strategy across multiple teams and platforms.
- **Achievements:** The benefits highlighted include improved incident detection and resolution, unified system visibility, and the ability to correlate metrics, logs, and traces for more effective analysis.
- **Lessons learned:** The team shares key takeaways about the importance of cross-team collaboration, standardizing tools and processes, and adapting organizational culture to fully leverage observability.
- **Business impact:** Thanks to observability, Adevinta has optimized operations, reduced incident response times, and improved the end-user experience.

This talk is a valuable reference for organizations looking to modernize their monitoring and management of complex systems, showcasing both obstacles and best practices for successful observability adoption.
