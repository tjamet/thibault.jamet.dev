# Technical Expertise & Leadership

I am a platform engineering leader with extensive experience in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and software development. My technical foundation spans Go, Python, Java, C, and SQL, complemented by advanced proficiency in Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS. At Adevinta, I have led critical infrastructure initiatives that transformed the organization's technical capabilities, including scaling Kubernetes clusters to handle a 60x increase in traffic capacity—from 5,000 to 300,000 requests per second at peak times.

Throughout my career progression from embedded systems at Sagemcom and DxO to backend engineering at Leboncoin and Schibsted, and now platform engineering leadership at Adevinta, I have consistently delivered high-impact solutions. Notable achievements include scaling Adevinta's Internal Developer Platform by a factor of 60 and contributions to open-source Kubernetes projects.

# Strategic Vision & Collaboration

I approach technical challenges with a methodical yet creative mindset, combining technical depth with strategic thinking. I have collaborated with my peers to define comprehensive strategies that align technical implementations with business goals. My leadership emphasizes clear communication, iterative planning, and customer-focused development—evident in how I've successfully led multi-team migrations to newer Kubernetes versions while minimizing disruption.

My multilingual capabilities—fluent in French, English and advanced Spanish, my ability to collaborate across cultural boundaries. I have leveraged these skills throughout my international career, working effectively in diverse environments and sharing knowledge through technical writing and presentations.

# Current Availability

I am currently open to new opportunities in senior backend or platform engineering, architecture, and technical leadership roles. I welcome discussions about full-time positions as well as consulting engagements related to Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, DevOps transformation, as well as backend development and developer experience optimization.
